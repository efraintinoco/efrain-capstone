# GameDay Ready

Hello everyone ! Welcome to my GameDay Ready app. As a passionate sports fan, there is nothing I love more than going out to 
catch a game in person. But its not just the action on the field that I love, itâ€™s the entire game day experience that comes with 
it. When things go as planned, the entire Game Day experience becomes is a day to remember! The GameDay ready app helps ensure that 
everything turns out as planned and the GameDay experience is just as special as the action on the field!
